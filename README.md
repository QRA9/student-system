This repo is a resource for writing and practising SQL. SQL is the language for interacting with a database. It helps in performing operations such as creating database objects such as 
tables and views, store and retrieve data, control access to the data and finally control when and how changes can be made in a database. The steps for creating and interacting with a 
database comprises of:

1. Data definition language - create data using statements such as CREATE, INSERT and UPDATE

2. Data manipulation language - manipulate data using statements like SELECT and functions such as those for AGGREGATING
 
3. Data control language -assign and remove permisions for using data using GRANT and REVOKE

4. Transaction control language - save and restore changes to a database using COMMIT and ROLLBACK
